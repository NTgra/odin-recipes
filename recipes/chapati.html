            <li>Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead several times. Divide into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into a very thin round using a rolling pin.</li>
